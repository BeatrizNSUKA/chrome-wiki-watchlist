version 0.5

 * Refactored timers to fetch data from HTTP more effectively.
 * Added 'subscribe' web intent handling.

version 0.4

 * Fixed some bugs in timeout handling.

version 0.3

 * Failed HTTP counter update now forces next update to be over HTTP
   as well. This should make the icon active again much faster after
   any service or network failures.
